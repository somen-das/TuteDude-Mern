            <h3>Color Units</h3>
            <p>In CSS, colors can be specified using various units and formats. Here are some common color units:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hexadecimal (Hex):</strong> A six-digit code representing the red, green, and blue components of a color. For example, #FF5733.</li>
                <li><strong>RGB:</strong> Stands for Red, Green, Blue. It uses the format rgb(255, 87, 51) where each value ranges from 0 to 255.</li>
                <li><strong>RGBA:</strong> Similar to RGB but includes an alpha channel for opacity. The format is rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5) where the last value ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).</li>
                <li><strong>HSL:</strong> Stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness. The format is hsl(9, 100%, 60%) where hue is an angle (0-360), saturation and lightness are percentages.</li>
                <li><strong>HSLA:</strong> Similar to HSL but includes an alpha channel for opacity. The format is hsla(9, 100%, 60%, 0.5).</li>
                <li><strong>Named Colors:</strong> CSS also supports named colors like "red", "blue", "green", etc.</li>
            </ul>
